Sometimes, the biggest challenges have nothing to do with your own code. That was the story of today. As I write this, my portfolio's build process is still stuck in a queue, a victim of a wider GitHub Actions outage. It's been a lesson in patience and a reminder that some things are just out of your control.

But that doesn't mean the day was lost. Far from it.

While the site itself was in gridlock, we got to work on the most important part: the content. We decided to build out the first real project page, a showcase for an AdventureWorks sales dashboard I created in Power BI.

This is where things got exciting. We started by creating the new project file, but a simple static image felt... well, static. The solution? An interactive image swiper. We dove into the theme's code and wired up a beautiful carousel to show off three different views of the report. It immediately felt more dynamic and professional.

Then came the next hurdle: embedding the Power BI report itself. The goal was to have a live, interactive dashboard right on the page. We quickly discovered that the standard embedding option required a Power BI loginâ€”a huge barrier for any recruiter or hiring manager. The ideal solution, "Publish to web," was unfortunately disabled by admin settings.

It was a classic real-world problem. You have a plan, but the tools or permissions don't quite line up. So, we pivoted. Instead of a broken embed, we opted for a clean, simple text link that says "here." It's an elegant solution that keeps the page looking clean and sets clear expectations for the user.

So, even though I can't see the final result live on my site just yet, the pieces are all in place. We have a fully-featured project page with an image slider and a smart solution for linking to the live report. Today was about building through the roadblocks, and I'm ending the day with a much stronger portfolio ready to go live the moment the digital traffic jam clears.
