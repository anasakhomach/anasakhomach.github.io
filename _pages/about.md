Your data is screaming at you – but are you listening? I am.
I'm the person who gets genuinely excited when I spot an outlier that everyone else wants to delete. While others see messy datasets, I see treasure hunts waiting to be solved. I'm that data detective who won't sleep until I've figured out why your conversion rates dropped 12% last Tuesday (spoiler: it wasn't the weather).
Here's what I do with your data chaos:

Clean & validate like I'm Marie Kondo, but for databases – if it doesn't spark insights, it gets optimized
Visualize stories that make your stakeholders go "wait, show me that chart again"
Build predictive models that are scary accurate (in a good way)
Hunt down insights hiding in the dark corners of your spreadsheets

I may not have a decade of corporate experience, but I have something better: genuine curiosity and the kind of obsessive attention to detail that makes me notice patterns others miss. I've spent countless hours wrestling with datasets just because I had to know what they were trying to tell me.
Warning: I might get a little too excited explaining why your data trends the way it does.
Ready to stop guessing and start knowing?
